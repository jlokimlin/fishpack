! USAGE                  call blktri(iflg, np, n, an, bn, cn, mp, m, &

!
! PURPOSE                blktri solves a system of linear equations
!                        of the form
!
!                        an(j)*x(i, j-1) + am(i)*x(i-1, j) +
!                        (bn(j)+bm(i))*x(i, j) + cn(j)*x(i, j+1) +
!                        cm(i)*x(i+1, j) = y(i, j)
!
!                        for i = 1, 2, ..., m  and  j = 1, 2, ..., n.
!
!                        i+1 and i-1 are evaluated modulo m and
!                        j+1 and j-1 modulo n, i.e.,
!
!                        x(i, 0) = x(i, n),  x(i, n+1) = x(i, 1),
!                        x(0, j) = x(m, j),  x(m+1, j) = x(1, j).
!
!                        These equations usually result from the
!                        discretization of separable elliptic
!                        equations. Boundary conditions may be
!                        dirichlet, neumann, or periodic.

!                               certain quantities that depend on np,
!                               n, an, bn, and cn are computed and
!                               stored in derived data type w (see
!                               description of w below)

!                               in the initialization are used
!                               to obtain the solution x(i, j).
!
!                               note:
!                               A call with iflg=0 takes
!                               approximately one half the time
!                               as a call with iflg = 1.
!                               however, the initialization does
!                               not have to be repeated unless np,
!                               n, an, bn, or cn change.

!                               which corresponds to periodic
!                               bounary conditions.
!
!                          = 1  If an(1) and cn(n) are zero.
!
!                        n

!                          n must be greater than 4.
!                          The operation count is proportional to
!                          m*n*log2(n), hence n should be selected
!                          less than or equal to m.
!
!                        an, bn, cn
!                          One-dimensional arrays of length n
!                          that specify the coefficients in the

!
!                        mp

!                               which corresponds to periodic
!                               boundary conditions.
!
!                          = 1  If am(1) = cm(m) = 0  .
!
!                        m
!                          The number of unknowns in the i-direction.
!                           m must be greater than 4.
!
!                        am, bm, cm
!                          One-dimensional arrays of length m that
!                          specify the coefficients in the linear
!                          equations given above.
!
!                        idimy
!                          The row (or first) dimension of the
!                          two-dimensional array y as it appears
!                          in the program calling blktri.
!                          This parameter is used to specify the
!                          variable dimension of y.
!                          idimy must be at least m.
!
!                        y
!                          A two-dimensional array that specifies
!                          the values of the right side of the linear
!                          system of equations given above.
!                          y must be dimensioned at least m*n.
!
!                        workspace
!                          An object of class(FishpackWorkspace)
!                          that must be declared by the user.  The first
!                          two declarative statements in the user program
!                          calling blktri must be:
!
!                               use type_FishpackWorkspace
!                               type(Fishpackworkspace) :: workspace
!
!                          The first statement makes the fishpack module
!                          defined in the file "type_FishpackWorkspace.f90"
!                          available to the user program calling blktri.
!                          The second statement declares a derived type variable
!                          (defined in the module "type_FishpackWorkspace.f90")
!                          which is used internally in blktri to dynamically
!                          allocate real and complex workspace used in solution.
!                          An error flag (ierror = 20) is set if the required
!                          workspace allocation fails (for example if n, m
!                          are too large). Real and complex values are set in
!                          the components of workspace on a initial (iflg=0)
!                          call to blktri.  These must be preserved on
!                          non-initial calls (iflg=1) to blktri.
!                          This eliminates redundant calculations
!                          and saves compute time.
!
!               ****       IMPORTANT!  The user program calling blktri should
!                          include the statement:
!
!                              call workspace%destroy()
!
!                          after the final approximation is generated by
!                          blktri. This will deallocate the real and complex
!                          array components of workspace. Failure to include this
!                          statement could result in serious memory leakage.

!
!                             Possible reasons for this condition are
!                             1. The arrays an and cn are not correct
!                             2. Too large a grid spacing was used
!                                in the discretization of the elliptic
!                                equation.
!                             3. The linear equations resulted from a
